        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p><strong>Omowale Okelola</strong> ‚Äì Actor | Director | Playwright | Drama Evangelist</p>
            <p>I am a passionate theater artist and drama minister dedicated to storytelling through stage performances and gospel drama. I use drama as a tool for evangelism, education, and social impact.</p>
            
            <h3>My Journey in Drama & Theater</h3>
            <p>With extensive training from Mount Zion Institute of Christian Drama (Nigeria), EbonyLife Creative Academy, and Praxy Digital Academy, I have honed my craft in acting, directing, and scriptwriting. My work brings compelling narratives to life on stage and screen.</p>
            
            <h3>Notable Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Gods Are Not to Blame</strong> by Ola Rotimi ‚Äì Featured as a lead actor in this classic Nigerian play.</li>
                <li><strong>Trials of Brother Jero</strong> by Wole Soyinka ‚Äì Acted and directed this satirical masterpiece.</li>
                <li><strong>Wedding Garment</strong> ‚Äì A gospel stage play co-produced with my wife, taken from church to church to deliver a message of hope and divine reward.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Drama as a Tool for Impact</h3>
            <p>Beyond entertainment, I mentor young minds through drama, visiting schools and training aspiring actors. During my volunteer missions, I equip crew members with storytelling skills to share impactful messages.</p>
            
            <h3>Volunteer & Humanitarian Work</h3>
            <p>I am a dedicated volunteer with <strong>Mercy Ships</strong>, serving in Cameroon, Senegal, and other African countries. During my missions, I train crew members in drama and help them use storytelling for positive change.</p>
            
            <h3>Drama Ministry & Evangelism</h3>
            <p>As the head of my church‚Äôs drama ministry, I direct gospel plays, skits, and short films that convey deep spiritual messages. Alongside my wife, I use drama as a means of evangelism, traveling across communities and churches to touch lives and transform hearts.</p>
            
            <h3>Let‚Äôs Connect</h3>
            <p>I am open to collaborations in film, theater, faith-based productions, and training programs. If you‚Äôre looking for an actor, director, playwright, or drama mentor, I‚Äôd love to connect!</p>
