        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate theater artist and drama minister dedicated to storytelling through stage performances and gospel drama. br About Me
Omowale Okelola – Actor | Director | Playwright | Drama Evangelist
I am Omowale Okelola, a passionate actor, director, and playwright with a deep commitment to using drama as a powerful tool for storytelling, evangelism, and social impact. With extensive training from prestigious institutions like Mount Zion Institute of Christian Drama (Nigeria), EbonyLife Creative Academy, and Praxy Digital Academy, I have honed my craft in acting, directing, and scriptwriting, bringing compelling narratives to life on stage and screen.

My Work in Drama & Theater
My journey in drama spans acting, directing, and mentoring, with a focus on productions that entertain, educate, and inspire. Some of my notable works include:

"The Gods Are Not to Blame" by Ola Rotimi – Featured as a lead actor in this classic Nigerian play.
"Trials of Brother Jero" by Wole Soyinka – Acted and directed this satirical masterpiece.
"Wedding Garment" – A gospel stage play, co-produced with my wife, which we take from church to church, delivering a message of hope and divine reward.
Drama as a Tool for Impact
Beyond entertainment, I am dedicated to mentoring and inspiring young minds through drama. I regularly visit secondary schools, using stage performances to encourage and educate students. In addition, I train interested crew members in drama during my volunteer missions, equipping them with the skills to use storytelling effectively.

Volunteer & Humanitarian Work
My passion extends beyond the stage—I am a committed volunteer, having served multiple times with Mercy Ships in Cameroon, Senegal, and other African countries. While on these missions, I not only contributed to humanitarian efforts but also trained interested crew members in drama, helping them harness the power of storytelling for positive change.

Drama Ministry & Evangelism
As the head of my church’s drama ministry, I am actively involved in producing and directing gospel plays, skits, and short films that convey deep spiritual messages. Alongside my wife, I am on a special mission to use drama as a means of evangelism and hope, traveling across communities and churches to stage performances that touch lives and transform hearts.

Let’s Connect
I am open to collaborations in film, theater, faith-based productions, and training programs. If you’re looking for an actor, director, playwright, or drama mentor, I’d love to connect!
